This is C++ program that scans a text document and it returns each unique word, the number of unique words, the frequency of each word used, and the number of total words in the text document. 

From this project I learned:

- In-depth features of the C++ STL library
- How to implement a map into a program (How to input information and retrieve information from a map)
- How to implement various different methods of the string class to parse certain words to make it easier for the map to read
